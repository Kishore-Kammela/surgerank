# SurgeRank Research Ops

## Goal
Turn research into reliable product decisions, not scattered notes.

## When To Use
- Competitive landscape updates
- API/provider feasibility checks
- Pricing benchmark refreshes
- Design-partner interview synthesis
- Risk and assumption validation

## Workflow
1. Define research question and business decision it informs.
2. Gather sources from primary docs and trusted external references.
3. Label each finding with confidence (`high`, `medium`, `low`).
4. Separate facts from assumptions.
5. Record decisions and open questions.

## Output Format
- Research question
- Key findings (evidence-backed)
- Assumptions and risks
- Recommendation
- Decision log entry

## Guardrails
- Never present unverified claims as facts.
- Always include date/context for benchmarks.
- Prefer official docs and first-party pricing pages where possible.

## Additional Resource
- Research template: [research-template.md](research-template.md)
