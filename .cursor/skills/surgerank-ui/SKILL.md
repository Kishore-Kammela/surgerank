# SurgeRank UI

## Goal
Present SEO/GEO intelligence with clarity and trust for agencies and their clients.

## Visual Direction
- Professional, calm, data-first.
- Strong information hierarchy.
- Conservative color semantics for status and severity.

## Component Standards
- Reuse shadcn primitives before adding custom components.
- Use consistent card patterns for KPI widgets.
- Ensure readable chart labels, legends, and date context.
- Keep table density high but legible for agency workflows.

## States Required
- Loading
- Empty
- Error
- Partial data / stale data

## Report UX
- Preview-first export layout.
- Print-safe spacing and typography.
- Explicit source timestamps and attribution.

## Deliverables
- Updated token or component usage
- UI acceptance checks (clarity, consistency, accessibility)
- Before/after rationale for major layout changes
