# SurgeRank Project Management

## Goal
Keep execution predictable while protecting launch scope.

## Operating Cadence
- Weekly planning and reprioritization
- Mid-week risk/dependency check
- Weekly launch-gate scorecard review
- End-of-week demo and decision log

## Planning Rules
- One in-progress priority stream at a time for high-risk work.
- Every task maps to a requirement or launch gate.
- Blockers and dependencies are tracked explicitly.

## Minimum Artifacts
- Weekly plan
- Risk register
- Dependency tracker
- Launch readiness checklist
- Scope and delivery docs updated via `surgerank-docs-ops` when planning changes occur

## Go/No-Go Discipline
- Evaluate against predefined launch gates.
- Record decision, rationale, and next actions.
- If gate fails, define a corrective sprint, not ad hoc fixes.

## Additional Resource
- PM weekly template: [pm-weekly-template.md](pm-weekly-template.md)
