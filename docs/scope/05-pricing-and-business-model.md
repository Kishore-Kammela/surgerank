# Pricing and Business Model

## Purpose
Define the canonical V1 packaging, pricing assumptions, and business metrics used for launch planning.

## Executive Summary
- V1 uses a three-tier agency pricing model.
- Packaging is designed to protect margin while keeping entry affordable.
- GEO is positioned as a Pro+ value differentiator for initial monetization clarity.

## Canonical V1 Packaging

| Plan | Monthly Price | Workspaces | Keyword Limit | GEO | Reporting | Team Seats |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Starter | $59 | Up to 5 | Up to 500 | Not included | Manual PDF export | 1 |
| Pro | $149 | Up to 20 | Up to 2,000 | Limited GEO monitoring | Manual + scheduled PDF | 3 |
| Agency | $349 | Up to 50 | Up to 10,000 | Expanded GEO limits | Manual + scheduled PDF + priority support | 10 |

## Add-On Model

| Add-On | Target Plan(s) | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extra keyword packs | Pro, Agency | Control usage expansion without forced plan jump |
| Extra workspace packs | Agency | Scale operations for larger agencies |
| GEO query packs | Pro, Agency | Monetize higher GEO usage safely |
| Premium onboarding | Agency | Improve activation and conversion quality |

## Pricing Contradiction Resolution

| Prior Conflict Across Legacy Docs | Canonical Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Keyword caps conflicted (`50/500/unlimited` vs `500/2000/10000`) | Adopt `500/2000/10000` for predictable value and pricing clarity |
| Starter GEO inclusion conflicted | GEO moved to Pro+ in canonical V1 packaging |
| Team seat limits conflicted (`1/5/unlimited` vs `1/3/10`) | Adopt `1/3/10` for simple and enforceable V1 packaging |
| API access timing conflicted | API access deferred post-V1; not part of launch packaging |

## Unit Economics Assumptions (V1 Planning)

| Metric | Working Assumption |
| --- | --- |
| Blended ARPA target | $120+ by month 6 |
| API cost as % of revenue | Keep below 25% |
| Gross margin target | >= 70% during early scale |
| Churn guardrail | < 10% early, trend toward < 5% |

## KPI Targets

| KPI | Month 3 | Month 6 | Month 12 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Paying agencies | 5 | 15-25 | 75-100 |
| MRR | $500+ | $2.5k-$4k | $12k-$15k |
| Active workspaces | 25+ | 150+ | 1,000+ |

## Key Decisions
- Canonical pricing matrix is now fixed for V1 planning.
- GEO monetization begins in Pro plan to preserve differentiation.

## Open Items
- Annual discount policy for early partner conversions.
- Overage pricing for GEO query packs.

## Next Actions
- Align billing enforcement logic with this table.
- Validate pricing with first design-partner interviews before public rollout.
