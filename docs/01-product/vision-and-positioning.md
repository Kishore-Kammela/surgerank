Define SurgeRank's long-term direction and market positioning in clear language.

## Positioning
- For: digital and SEO agencies with multiple clients.

## Positioning Pillars
1. Agency command center for multi-client operations.
2. SEO + GEO in one workflow.
3. Report-ready outputs, not just raw dashboards.
4. Cost-aware, practical stack for rapid delivery and adoption.

## Non-Goals (V1)

## Risks and Mitigations

- Incumbent overlap -> compete on workflow speed and agency clarity.
