# V2 Preview

## Purpose
Provide lightweight roadmap context beyond V1 without expanding current delivery scope.

## Audience
Stakeholders, PM, engineering, design partners.

## Executive Summary
- V2 builds on validated V1 workflows.
- V2 themes: depth, extensibility, and agency scale features.

## V2 Priority Themes
1. GEO depth expansion (more engines, richer citation analytics).
2. Workflow scale (team permissions, advanced reporting controls).
3. Integration expansion (selected high-impact channels).

## Candidate V2 Features
- Expanded GEO benchmarking and source analysis.
- Report builder customization depth.
- Additional connector support based on partner demand.
- Controlled API access for advanced agencies.

## V2 Entry Criteria
- V1 launch gates met for activation, retention, and reliability.
- Stable operations and acceptable support load.
- Clear demand signals from design partners and paying customers.

## Scope Guardrail
V2 preview informs planning only. It does not alter V1 commitments.
